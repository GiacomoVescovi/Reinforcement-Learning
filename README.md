## Contnent of this repository
This repository contains the Python script for the approximantion of the optimal strategy in the optimal investment problem using the Q-Learning
 algorithm within the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein model for the price evolution of a financial asset. It's possible to visualize the allocation for the learned portfolio allocations after 50,000, 500,000 and 5,000,000 episodes.

## Context
Let $T \in \mathbb{N}$ be a finite time horizon, $q \in (0,1)$ and $u, d > -1$ with $d < u$.  
We fix a sequence of independent Bernoulli random variables $R_1, \ldots, R_T$ taking values in $\{d, u\}$ such that

$$
\mathbb{P}[R_t = u] = q \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbb{P}[R_t = d] = 1 - q, 
\qquad t = 1, \ldots, T.
$$

The process $P = (P_t\)_{t=0, \ldots, T}$ with $P_0 \in \mathbb{R}$ and

$$
P_t := (1 + R_t) P_{t-1}, 
\qquad t = 1, \ldots, T
$$

models the price of a financial asset in the *Cox–Ross–Rubinstein (CRR)* model.

The following figure shows the evolution of the risky asset in the CRR model:

### Interpretation

- Each step corresponds to one time increment $t = 1, \ldots, T$.  
- At each step, the asset price either moves **up** by a factor $1 + u$ with probability $q$,  
  or **down** by a factor $1 + d$ with probability $1 - q$.  
- The resulting tree describes all possible price paths after $T$ periods.
